                                            <p>Founded in 2003 by Jerry Gray, TeamOne Logistics is a workforce partner based in Alpharetta,
                                              Georgia, that is focused on the asset-based transportation and logistics industry. Aiming to be

                                            <p>The transportation logistics industry comes with many unique issues and TeamOne needed a

                                              plan. As TeamOne consider the options, Georgia Oaks stood out due to its commitment to local
                                              businesses, economic growth, and focus on securing legacy. The partnership launched in December of 2012, and Georgia Oaks assisted TeamOne on several fronts by focusing on a long-term

Siplon spoke about the impact the partnership has had on the company: “Sharing my vision for growth with the team drives strong morale in a big way. Our growth impacts
                                              every single one of us on the team, and we all need to work together to make it happen.”</p>

                                            <p>Today, TeamOne has become leaders in the transportation logistics industry. The COVID-19
                                              pandemic accentuated several challenges in transportation logistics, such as increased driver
                                              shortages and costs of shipping. “Both finding people and keeping them is becoming more and
                                              more difficult,” Siplon explained. “In March, we hit a record low for commercial driver availability.” TeamOne is trusted to help its clients navigate these issues through an experienced team
                                              of employees with broad expertise across the country. A dedicated focus on building legacy and
                                              economic growth through the partnership with Georgia Oaks has helped TeamOne become a

                                          <p>Founded in 2003 by Jerry Gray, TeamOne Logistics is a workforce partner based in Alpharetta,
                                            Georgia, that is focused on the asset-based transportation and logistics industry. Aiming to be

                                          <p>The transportation logistics industry comes with many unique issues and TeamOne needed a
                                            partner to help navigate those industry-specific issues and execute a top-line growth strategy
                                            plan. As TeamOne consider the options, Georgia Oaks stood out due to its commitment to local
                                            businesses, economic growth, and focus on securing legacy. The partnership launched in December of 2012, and Georgia Oaks assisted TeamOne on several fronts by focusing on a long-term
                                            strategy plan and providing additional leadership capabilities. Georgia Oaks operating partner
                                            Dean Ditmar joined TeamOne as Chief Commercial Officer to assist CEO Page Siplon in growing the company. Siplon spoke about the impact the partnership has had on the company: “Sharing my vision for growth with the team drives strong morale in a big way. Our growth impacts
                                            every single one of us on the team, and we all need to work together to make it happen.”</p>

                                          <p>Today, TeamOne has become leaders in the transportation logistics industry. The COVID-19
                                            pandemic accentuated several challenges in transportation logistics, such as increased driver
                                            shortages and costs of shipping. “Both finding people and keeping them is becoming more and
                                            more difficult,” Siplon explained. “In March, we hit a record low for commercial driver availability.” TeamOne is trusted to help its clients navigate these issues through an experienced team
                                            of employees with broad expertise across the country. A dedicated focus on building legacy and
                                            economic growth through the partnership with Georgia Oaks has helped TeamOne become a
